<chapter title="Introduction" file="Intro">

The global clipboard provides a way of transferring data between applications. You select the data in one application and cut or copy it onto the clipboard (usually using <key>Ctrl-X</key> and <key>Ctrl-C</key>). You then move to the other application and paste the data from the clipboard (usually <key>Ctrl-V</key>).

<cite>Clipper</cite> allows you to save the current contents of the global clipboard, either to disc or to another application. You can also drag files from a filer window to <cite>Clipper</cite> to put that file on the clipboard.

The <cite>IcnClipBrd</cite> module, which allows you to cut and paste in writeable icons using the global clipboard, is no longer supplied with <cite>Clipper</cite>, but is available from <link ref="http://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/software/clipboard/">http://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/software/clipboard/</link>.

The <cite>Clipper</cite> utility was originally called <cite>Clipboard</cite> and written, along with the <cite>IcnClipBrd</cite> module, by Thomas Leonard. It was converted to 32-bit for use on RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;5 by myself (Stephen Fryatt), and was renamed <cite>Clipper</cite> in 2020 to resolve a clash with a legitimately-allocated application name. I would like to thank Thomas for allowing his code to be placed in the Public Domain; any problems encountered using the updated application and module are likely to be my fault and should be reported first to the address below.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Installation" file="Install">

To use <cite>Clipper</cite>, simply run it from a Filer window. If you always want it on the iconbar, it can be included in the list of applications to be run at startup in the <icon>Boot</icon> section of Configure.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Using Clipper" file="Use">

Once <cite>Clipper</cite> is loaded, it will install an icon on the icon bar. Click <mouse>select</mouse> on this icon to open the <window>Save clipboard</window> window. If there is anything on the clipboard then you will be able to drag the icon to a directory or to another application to save the clipboard. You can put a file onto the clipboard by dragging it to this window.

If you toggle the window size then you can see an extra box which indicates what <cite>Clipper</cite> is doing. This may be helpful for programmers trying to work out why their program doesn&rsquo;t work with <cite>Clipper</cite>. Note that the problem may well be <cite>Clipper</cite>&rsquo;s fault!

</chapter>




<chapter title="Other information" file="Other">

<cite>Clipper</cite> was written by Thomas Leonard. The 32-bit conversion was done by Stephen Fryatt.

<subhead title="Version 0.03 (22 October 1996)">

<list>
<li>Wrote most of <cite>IcnClipBrd</cite> including transfer of clipboard via <code>Wimp$Scrap</code> and sending using RAM transfer (but not yet receiving data this way).
</list>


<subhead title="Version 0.04 (23 October 1996)">

<list>
<li>Added support for RAM fetch, but had to remove it because it didn&rsquo;t work with some programs which close all menus when you use RAM transfer!
</list>


<subhead title="Version 0.05 (08 September 1998)">

<list>
<li>Made WimpSlot 36K, as someone said it wouldn't run on their computer with 32K. Changed the window layout to make the Owner box bigger.
<li>Fixed serious bug &ndash; didn&rsquo;t work if &lt;Wimp$Scrap&gt; already existed!
</list>


<subhead title="Version 0.06 (15 September 1998)">

<list>
